    <h1>Basic info</h1>
    
    <h2><p>Cats are loyal housemates. Cats are also civilized housemates. Unlike dogs, cats don't bark or make other loud noises; most cats don't even meow that often. Cats don't usually have accidents; mother cats train their kittens to use the litter box, and most cats will use it without fail from that time on.</p>
      
      
      
      <p>Did you ever wonder why love fish? i am gonna answer is in this pharagraph... cats actually like fish because cats are actually attracted to the strong smell seafood gives off, so the second they catch a whiff of that unmistakable aroma, excitement levels instantly shoot up. Fish is also an excellent source of protein and healthy fats, making it a dietary delight for nutrient-craving bodies.</p> 
      
      
      <p> Have you ever wonder why love milk? The answer of that is because cats love the taste of milk because it is high in fat. They will often choose to drink it even if it results in an upset stomach. If your cat is fed a high quality, balanced diet they do not need the extra fat from drinking milk, no matter how much they</p> 



      <p> So give them fish and milk or they might ger mad</p></h2>
