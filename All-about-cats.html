      <h1>Basic info</h1>

      <h2><p>Cats are loyal housemates. Cats are also civilized housemates. Unlike dogs, cats don't bark or make other loud noises; most cats don't even meow that often. Cats don't usually have accidents; mother cats train their kittens to use the litter box, and most cats will use it without fail from that time on.</p>

        <p>Did you ever wonder why cats love fish? i am gonna answer it in this pharagraph... cats actually like fish because cats are actually attracted to the strong smell seafood gives off, so the second they catch a whiff of that unmistakable aroma, excitement levels instantly shoot up.

        <p> Have you ever wonder why love milk? The answer of that is because cats love the taste of milk because it is high in fat. They will often choose to drink it even if it results in an upset stomach.

        <p>Cats are known for their playful and curious nature, and their toy preferences often reflect their instinctual behaviors. Toys that mimic prey, such as feather wands, laser pointers, and small, crinkly balls, captivate their attention and provide an outlet for their hunting instincts. Interactive toys that challenge their problem-solving skills, like puzzle feeders and treat-dispensing balls, also engage their minds and keep them entertained. Additionally, soft, plush toys and catnip-filled items can offer comfort and stimulation. By catering to these varied interests, cat toys not only provide physical exercise but also contribute to their mental well-being.</p>
